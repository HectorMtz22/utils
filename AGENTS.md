# Agent workflow for this repo

This file captures how feature work is done in this repo by automated coding
agents (Claude Code with the `superpowers` plugin and the **Plane** MCP server).
It's a recipe, not a rule. Tracker coordinates live in
[`.claude/tracker.md`](.claude/tracker.md). **Always use superpowers** — invoke
the named skill at each stage. See [`HARNESS.md`](HARNESS.md) for the full TDD
detail.

Four slash commands wrap the loop — a planning pair and a building pair, each
scaling from a single task to a whole epic/backlog: **`/task-init`** /
**`/issues-init`** (front half) and **`/task-implement`** / **`/task-run`**
(back half).

## TL;DR

1. **`/task-init`** runs `superpowers:brainstorming` → a design at
   `docs/superpowers/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md` (gitignored, local-only)
   → files **Plane issue(s)** in the `UTILS` project (state `Todo`, project +
   type labels, current cycle). For a broad goal, **`/issues-init`** does the same
   at epic scale: it decomposes into many PR-sized issues, files them under a
   parent epic, and sets **blocks/blocked-by** relations so the backlog is
   pre-ordered.
2. **`/task-implement [UTILS-…]`** picks up the issue(s) and, for each, moves it
   to `In Progress` and **creates a worktree** under `.worktrees/<topic>/` on a
   new branch (gitignored) via `superpowers:using-git-worktrees`. To run the
   backlog instead of naming issues, **`/task-run`** derives parallel/sequential
   batches (from those relations + file-overlap), then drives this same machinery
   batch by batch.
3. **Dispatch a subagent** to implement inside that worktree, following TDD.
   Multiple issues → `superpowers:dispatching-parallel-agents`, one agent per
   worktree, in a single message.
4. **Run `superpowers:requesting-code-review`** on each branch.
5. **Report findings, ask before fixing** (per the user's global rule).
6. **Open a PR automatically** once the branch is verified, green, committed, and
   clean (no Important+ findings remain), then move the Plane issue to
   **In Review** (and to **Done** when the PR merges). Only the fix decision in
   step 5 waits for the user.

## Why worktrees

Subagents touch a lot of files. Doing implementation in a separate worktree on a
feature branch keeps the main checkout clean and lets the parent agent inspect
the diff without context pollution.

When two or more independent tasks are dispatched in parallel, each gets its own
worktree, branch, and PR, so the diffs never tangle. Worktree setup goes through
`superpowers:using-git-worktrees`; implementation **always** happens in a
worktree, never in the main checkout.

```bash
git worktree add -b <type>/<scope>-<topic> .worktrees/<topic> main
```

`.worktrees/` is gitignored.

## Issue tracking — Plane

Issues live in **Plane**, not in local files. Project **Utils** (identifier
`UTILS`; read `project_id` from `.claude/tracker.md`). `/task-init` /
`/issues-init` file them; `/task-implement` / `/task-run` read and advance them.

- **States:** `Todo` → `In Progress` → `In Review` (PR open) → `Done` (merged)
  (resolve ids at runtime via `list_states`; Plane ships without `In Review` —
  `/harness-bootstrap` creates it).
- **Labels:** one **project** label (`pdf_crop`, `music-lyrics`, `thermal-qr`,
  `pxe-boot`) plus one **type** label (`feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `test`, `docs`,
  `chore`) per issue (resolve via `list_labels`).
- **Cycles:** new issues go into the **current weekly cycle** (resolve via
  `list_cycles`); `/harness-bootstrap` provisions the Mon→Sun cycles.
- One issue ≈ one PR-sized chunk; independent issues enable parallel agents.
- The issue description carries the problem/approach/code-map/test-list and a
  pointer to the local spec filename.

## Why a separate spec workspace

`docs/superpowers/specs/` holds design docs the agent uses to align with the user
before coding. They are local-only (gitignored) because they're scratch
artifacts, not project documentation. The committed PR description and code are
the durable record.

## Subagents

For an implementation task that's bigger than a single edit, use
`superpowers:subagent-driven-development` to dispatch a subagent with:

- A pointer to its **Plane issue** and the linked design doc.
- The exact worktree path and a "do not touch the main checkout or sibling
  worktrees" instruction.
- An explicit code map (files to touch).
- A "report back briefly" instruction (so the parent's context isn't flooded).

When tasks run in parallel, use `superpowers:dispatching-parallel-agents`:
dispatch one subagent per worktree in a single message. Keep them on disjoint
files; sequence anything that overlaps. `/task-run` derives that disjoint set
from the backlog for you.

The parent verifies the diff and test results
(`superpowers:verification-before-completion`) before moving on.

## Code review

Always run `/superpowers:requesting-code-review` before opening a PR. Report
findings to the user grouped by severity. **Do not auto-fix** — the user decides
which items are in scope.

## Commit messages

Agent commits in this repo skip the `Co-Authored-By: Claude <...>` trailer, and
PR bodies skip the "Generated with Claude Code" footer. Keep the subject and
body, drop the attribution — the PR already signals the author.

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):
`<type>(<scope>): <subject>`. Common types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `test`,
`docs`, `chore`. The scope is usually the top-level project directory (e.g.
`pdf_crop`, `music-lyrics`).

## Tests first

Implementation follows TDD: write the failing test, watch it fail, make it pass,
refactor. Subagents dispatched for non-trivial work should be told to
red/green/refactor and to include the failing-test commit in the diff (or at
minimum show the failing run in their report).
