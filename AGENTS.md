# Agent workflow for this repo

This file captures how feature work is done in this repo by automated coding agents (Claude Code with the `superpowers` plugin and the **Plane** MCP server). It's a recipe, not a rule. **Always use superpowers** — invoke the named skill at each stage. See [`HARNESS.md`](HARNESS.md) for the full TDD detail.

Two slash commands wrap the loop: **`/task-init`** (front half) and **`/task-implement`** (back half).

## TL;DR

1. **`/task-init`** runs `superpowers:brainstorming` → a design at `docs/superpowers/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md` (gitignored, local-only) → files **Plane issue(s)** in the `UTILS` project (state `Todo`, project + type labels).
2. **`/task-implement [UTILS-…]`** picks up the issue(s) and, for each, moves it to `In Progress` and **creates a worktree** under `.worktrees/<topic>/` on a new branch (gitignored) via `superpowers:using-git-worktrees`.
3. **Dispatch a subagent** to implement inside that worktree, following TDD. Multiple issues → `superpowers:dispatching-parallel-agents`, one agent per worktree, in a single message.
4. **Run `superpowers:requesting-code-review`** on each branch.
5. **Report findings, ask before fixing** (per the user's global rule).
6. **Open a PR** (when asked) if no Important+ findings remain, then set the Plane issue to **Done**.

## Why worktrees

Subagents touch a lot of files. Doing implementation in a separate worktree on a feature branch keeps the main checkout clean and lets the parent agent inspect the diff without context pollution.

When two or more independent tasks are dispatched in parallel, each gets its own worktree, branch, and PR, so the diffs never tangle. Worktree setup goes through `superpowers:using-git-worktrees`; implementation **always** happens in a worktree, never in the main checkout.

```bash
git worktree add -b <type>/<scope>-<topic> .worktrees/<topic> main
```

`.worktrees/` is gitignored.

## Issue tracking — Plane

Issues live in **Plane**, not in local files. Project **Utils** (identifier `UTILS`, `project_id 43bbc122-c9fe-469e-9379-db02d132a5c9`). `/task-init` files them; `/task-implement` reads and advances them.

- **States:** `Todo` → `In Progress` → `Done` (resolve ids at runtime via `list_states`).
- **Labels:** one **project** label (`pdf_crop`, `music-lyrics`, `thermal-qr`, `pxe-boot`) plus one **type** label (`feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `test`, `docs`, `chore`) per issue (resolve via `list_labels`).
- One issue ≈ one PR-sized chunk; independent issues enable parallel agents.
- The issue description carries the problem/approach/code-map/test-list and a pointer to the local spec filename.

## Why a separate spec workspace

`docs/superpowers/specs/` holds design docs the agent uses to align with the user before coding. They are local-only (gitignored) because they're scratch artifacts, not project documentation. The committed PR description and code are the durable record.

## Subagents

For an implementation task that's bigger than a single edit, use `superpowers:subagent-driven-development` to dispatch a subagent with:

- A pointer to its **Plane issue** and the linked design doc.
- The exact worktree path and a "do not touch the main checkout or sibling worktrees" instruction.
- An explicit code map (files to touch).
- A "report back briefly" instruction (so the parent's context isn't flooded).

When tasks run in parallel, use `superpowers:dispatching-parallel-agents`: dispatch one subagent per worktree in a single message. Keep them on disjoint files; sequence anything that overlaps.

The parent verifies the diff and test results (`superpowers:verification-before-completion`) before moving on.

## Code review

Always run `/superpowers:requesting-code-review` before opening a PR. Report findings to the user grouped by severity. **Do not auto-fix** — the user decides which items are in scope.

## Commit messages

Agent commits in this repo skip the `Co-Authored-By: Claude <...>` trailer. Keep the subject and body, drop the trailer — the PR already signals the author.

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/): `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`. Common types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `test`, `docs`, `chore`. The scope is usually the top-level project directory (e.g. `pdf_crop`, `music-lyrics`).

## Tests first

Implementation follows TDD: write the failing test, watch it fail, make it pass, refactor. Subagents dispatched for non-trivial work should be told to red/green/refactor and to include the failing-test commit in the diff (or at minimum show the failing run in their report).
